## Craigslist on Rails

Project from DBC turned into a breakable toy. This CL clone has been pulled out of the depths of my repository for me to use Bootstrap on. And also for me to experiment with Devise.

Application uses Rails 4.0.2, bcrypt, faker, SQLite3, and Bootstrap.

### Getting Started

1)`bundle`

2)`rake db:create`

3)`rake db:migrate`

4)`rake db:seed`(optional)

You can log in by using a dummy account that was created in the seed file, email: "fake@fake.com" password: "password".
