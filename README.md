## Craigslist on Rails

Project from DBC turned into a breakable toy. This CL clone has been pulled out of the depths of my repository for me to use Bootstrap on. And also for me to experiment with Devise.

### Getting Started

1)`bundle`

2)`rake db:create`

3)`rake db:migrate`

4)`rake db:seed`(optional)

You can log in by using a dummy account that was created in the seed file, email: "fake@fake.com" password: "password".

### End Product

~~Looks like I never got a chance to work some css magic on this project.~~
The magic happens now!
