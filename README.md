## Craigslist on Rails

Dummy version of CL, but on rails. Create a user profile, log in, and I will have to double check on the rest. I believe we were to be able to create an ad and send a inquery on someone else's ad, not sure if we got that far.

### Getting Started

1)`bundle`

2)`rake db:create`

3)`rake db:migrate`

4)`rake db:seed`(optional)

You can log in by using a dummy account that was created in the seed file, email: "fake@fake.com" password: "password".

### End Product

Looks like I never got a chance to work some css magic on this project.
